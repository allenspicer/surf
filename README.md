# surf
Get a peek at the break before you get to the beach

This iOS app is built with Swift 4.0 atop UIKit, CoreLocation, and an MVC design pattern. It utilizes multi-threading, haptics, automatic storage, Protocols, Extentions and other Swift tools to deliver a seamless user-oriented experience.

The app coordinates the use of multiple NOAA public APIs to give users a picture of the current conditions at their favorite surf spot.
